<h1>Enter the Maison du Roi. Find the little boy!</h1>
<p>During the Ommegang celebration in the Grand Place, a family comprising a father and a mother took their three years old young boy by the hand and went out to see the Emperor Charles Quint and his family. There were many people in the streets and the young lad, who wanted to see everything, tugged so hard that he became separated from his parents and found himself alone in the crowd. His worried parents have been searching high and low for him for two days now but they had still not found him. 
Using the clues left in the museum, investigate to find the lost boy and help the family getting reunited!</p>

<p>Apparently, the boy was last seeing talking to a lady wearing this black dress. Can you find her in one of the artworks? Maybe the little boy is still with her!</p>
